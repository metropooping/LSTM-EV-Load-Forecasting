# EV Charging Demand Forecasting

This repository contains two LSTM-based models for forecasting electric vehicle (EV) charging load:

1. **Baseline** - Uses only historical EV load data.
2. **With Features** - Incorporates additional variables such as weather and traffic.

## Folder Structure
- `Baseline/` – Basic LSTM model with load data only.
- `LSTM_WEEKLY/` – Enhanced LSTM model using engineered features.
- `README.md` – Project overview.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
